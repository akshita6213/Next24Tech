# Project Collection

This repository contains several machine learning and data science projects, each focusing on different techniques and datasets. Below is a brief description of each project.

## 1. Housing Prediction Project (`Housing_Prediction_Project.ipynb`)

### Description
This project aims to predict house prices using various machine learning models. The dataset includes features like square footage, number of bedrooms, and neighborhood information. The goal is to build a model that accurately estimates the price of a house based on these attributes.


### Libraries Used
- pandas
- scikit-learn
- matplotlib
- seaborn

## 2. Recommendation System (`Recommendation_System.ipynb`)

### Description
This project develops a recommendation system for suggesting items to users based on their preferences and behaviors. It explores collaborative filtering, content-based filtering, and hybrid methods.


### Libraries Used
- pandas
- numpy
- scikit-learn
- surprise



## 3. Spam-Ham Projects Using Word2Vec, Average Word Vectors (`Spam_Ham_Projects_Using_Word2vec_AvgWordVectors.ipynb`)

### Description
This project enhances the spam classification task by using Word2Vec for better feature representation. It compares traditional TF-IDF methods with Word2Vec and evaluates the performance of different classifiers.

### Key Components
- Word2Vec model for word embeddings
- Feature extraction using average word vectors
- Model training and comparison (Logistic Regression, Random Forest, etc.)
- Visualization of word vectors and classification results

### Libraries Used
- gensim
- scikit-learn
- matplotlib
- nltk
